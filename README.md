## 📌 What is Image-to-Text OCR?

**OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** is a technology that extracts **text from images**. This project allows you to upload or process image files (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`) and get the **actual text content** embedded in them.

💡 This can be useful for:
- Digitizing printed documents
- Extracting text from receipts, invoices, or handwritten notes
- Enabling search on scanned books or forms

## 🚀 Key Features

✅ Convert images to editable text  
✅ Support for multiple image formats  
✅ Easy-to-use Python code  
✅ Lightweight and fast processing  
✅ Optionally extract text from bulk images

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- 🐍 **Python** – Core programming language  
- 🧠 **Tesseract OCR** – Powerful open-source OCR engine  
- 📷 **Pillow** – For image processing  
- 🔠 **Pytesseract** – Python wrapper for Tesseract  
- 📁 **OS/Pathlib** – For file handling  

---

## 📥 How It Works (Theoretical Flow)

1. 🖼️ **Load an Image**  
   - The image is imported using Pillow or OpenCV.

2. 🎯 **Pass to OCR Engine**  
   - The image is fed into Tesseract, which recognizes text.

3. 📝 **Extract and Display Text**  
   - The detected text is returned as a string and printed or stored.

4. 📂 **Optional: Batch Process**  
   - The script can loop through a folder of images and extract text from all.

## 🔐 Why Use OCR?

OCR makes **scanned text usable** again! Imagine having:

- Old scanned books 📚  
- Forms with typed or handwritten text 📝  
- Business cards 📇  
Now you can extract and **reuse** that information in digital workflows!

## 🧑‍💻 Sample Code Overview

```python
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract

# Load an image
img = Image.open('sample_image.jpg')

# Extract text
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)

# Output text
print(text)
